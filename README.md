Next stages of development would be...

-add interactivity to the page using a carousel for the product images
-wire up the forms
-I would create a custom import file similar to C:\Users\steho\Documents\Websites\SilentNight\node_modules\bootstrap\scss\bootstrap.scss
This would allow me to import only the modules required from bootstrap to improve performance.
-possibly move into a React app and convert HTML to JSX and sepertae into component
-Possibly move into an MVC environment and create partial views for the header, content and footer.
