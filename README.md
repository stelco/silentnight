## Silentnight interview code test

##Overview
Built using Bootstrap 4 and SASS.
We create a task called sass, and inside of it, we have to tell it the src of these sass files. We first take the bootstrap.scss file in the node_modules folder, and then any * .scss file inside of our /src/scss folder. All files are compiled to css here /src/css.
All code is built with a responsive view.

##Test Expansion
Next stages of this development would be as follows...

-add interactivity to the page with a carousel for the product images.
-wire up the forms
-create a custom SASS variable file similar to \node_modules\bootstrap\scss\bootstrap.scss
this would only import the required components and therefore improve performance.
-possibly look at React and convert all HTML to JSX and create components.
-Possibly move into an MVC environment and create partials for different areas of the page. eg. header, content and footer
